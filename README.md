## Description of the project

### In your groups:

1. Select a business (this can be a concrete firm or a hypothetical firm in an industry of your choice). Define a question that would be of interest to this business and require in-depth analysis to answer. The question should be answerable using business analytics tools together with data publicly available on the internet (it may be that fully answering this question requires a combination of the publicly available data and internal data). An example could be that your employer has made important adjustments to its marketing strategy and is concerned about learning the effect on its brand reputation. A look at Amazon reviews, newspaper reporting and Twitter activity over time may shed more light on the impact of these changes. 

2. Collect the publicly available data required to answer your chosen question using Python and the web scraping and API tools discussed in class. You are free to use any of BeautifulSoup/Requests, Selenium, Scrapy, Splash, a combination, or more advanced tools. However, it is essential that there be a significant web scraping component (e.g., navigating to a page and downloading a pre-made dataset will not be enough).

3. Using Python, pre-process the data you obtained using the tools discussed in class, both for cleaning and feature engineering.

4. Generate a lexicon of your dataset. This should be a table containing the names of the features in your dataset in one column, the descriptions of the features in the second column, and the units of the features in the third column. See Table 1 from chimera_exercise.pdf (Week 3 materials) for an example.

5. Using Python, produce summary statistics and visualizations of the key features in your dataset relevant to answering the question.

6. Describe the next steps required to answer the question, including the additional data sources needed and how you would go about gathering them.

7. Produce a companion document that describes and comments your solutions to the previous points in plain English.

### Deliverables

By November 14 (11:59 pm), you are supposed to submit the following package:

- The complete Python code used, which should be fully executable and understandable by a (this can be a notebook, but it doesn’t have to be)

- A companion document in PDF-format. The format and length are up to you, but a high added value per page is preferred. The following contents should be included: (i) The choice of question, including its relevance, and the data required to solve the question, (ii) your approach to scraping the data, the challenges you encounter, and the way you overcome these challenges, (iii) your approach to pre-processing the data, including the reasoning behind the features you engineer, (iv) the lexicon of your dataset, (v) visualizations of the most relevant features of your data, (vi) an outline of the additional data required to fully answer the question, as well as the analytics approach you would take under the assumption you had all necessary data

- A slideshow with 5-10 slides that summarizes the project. Some groups will be selected at random to present their work in class. You should aim for a 5-minute presentation.


### Assessment

Your submission will be evaluated against four criteria:

- appropriate use of concepts and frameworks discussed in class
- effectiveness of the proposed answer/solution
- originality and creativity of the proposed answer/solution
- organization and clarity of submitted materials
